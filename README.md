# Comet JEDI-Stack Setup

This script will setup the JEDI Stack on Comet.

1. mkdir /cw3e/mead/projects/path/to/my/folder
1. cd /cw3e/mead/projects/path/to/my/folder
1. git clone https://github.com/CW3E/comet-jedi-stack.git
1. cd comet-jedi-stack
1. ./RUNME.sh

That should be it. The script will setup everything needed to get the JEDI Stack up and running. This setup uses Intel Compiler & MPI 2020u4 and gnu 8.3.0
